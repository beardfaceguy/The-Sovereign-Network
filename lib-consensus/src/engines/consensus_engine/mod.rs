//! Consensus engine — Tendermint-like BFT
//!
//! # Consensus Algorithm Specification
//!
//! ## Algorithm Variant: Tendermint-like BFT
//!
//! This consensus engine implements a **Tendermint-like Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT)**
//! consensus algorithm. It is derived from the Tendermint protocol as described in:
//! "The latest gossip on BFT consensus" (Buchman et al., 2018).
//!
//! ### Key Properties Inherited from Tendermint
//!
//! - **Safety** (agreement): No two honest validators ever commit different blocks at the
//!   same height, even in the presence of up to f < n/3 Byzantine validators.
//! - **Liveness** (progress): Under a partially-synchronous network model (after GST),
//!   the protocol eventually commits a block at every height.
//! - **Accountability**: Byzantine validators that equivocate can be detected and slashed.
//!
//! ### Phases Per Round
//!
//! Each consensus round progresses through the following steps in order:
//! 1. **Propose** — The designated leader (proposer) broadcasts a proposal.
//! 2. **PreVote** — All validators broadcast a prevote for the proposal (or nil).
//! 3. **PreCommit** — Upon receiving 2f+1 prevotes, validators broadcast a precommit.
//! 4. **Commit** — Upon receiving 2f+1 precommits, the block is committed and finalized.
//!
//! ## Leader Rotation Rule: Round-Robin by Height
//!
//! The proposer (leader) for a given (height, round) is selected **deterministically**
//! using a round-robin algorithm keyed by height:
//!
//! ```text
//! proposer_index = (height + round) % num_validators
//! proposer = sorted_validator_set[proposer_index]
//! ```
//!
//! - The validator set is sorted by identity ID for determinism across all nodes.
//! - At height H, round 0: the leader is `validators[(H) % n]`.
//! - At height H, round R > 0: the leader is `validators[(H + R) % n]`.
//! - This ensures every validator gets an equal opportunity to propose over time.
//! - Leader selection is a pure function of (height, round, validator_set) — no randomness.
//!
//! See `LEADER_ROTATION_RULE` constant and `compute_proposer_for_round()` for enforcement.
//!
//! ## View-Change Trigger Conditions
//!
//! A **view-change** (round increment) is triggered when the current round fails to
//! produce a committed block. The following conditions independently trigger a view-change:
//!
//! 1. **Proposal timeout**: The proposer did not deliver a valid proposal within
//!    `ConsensusConfig::propose_timeout` milliseconds.
//! 2. **PreVote timeout**: The prevote step did not collect 2f+1 prevotes within
//!    `ConsensusConfig::prevote_timeout` milliseconds.
//! 3. **PreCommit timeout**: The precommit step did not collect 2f+1 precommits within
//!    `ConsensusConfig::precommit_timeout` milliseconds.
//! 4. **Liveness stall**: The liveness monitor detects that >f validators are unresponsive,
//!    making quorum impossible (see `LivenessMonitor::is_stalled()`).
//!
//! On view-change: `round += 1`, proposer rotates per the round-robin rule, and a new
//! proposal is awaited. The locked value (if any) from the previous round is preserved
//! per Tendermint safety rules.
//!
//! See `VIEW_CHANGE_CONDITIONS` constant and `RoundTimer` for enforcement.
//!
//! # Enforced Invariants for BFT Safety
//!
//! This consensus engine enforces the following invariants to ensure BFT safety:
//!
//! ## Vote Validity (Local and Deterministic)
//!
//! Vote validity is local and deterministic. A remote vote is accepted only if ALL
//! of the following conditions hold. Invalid votes are rejected immediately and never stored:
//!
//! 1. **Signature**: Cryptographically valid, verified against the vote's own data (height/round), not local state
//! 2. **Validator membership**: Sender is in the validator set for the target height (height-scoped)
//! 3. **Height**: vote.height == local.height (stale past-height votes are discarded;
//!    future-height votes trigger catch-up sync and are discarded)
//! 4. **Round**: vote.round >= local.round (stale rounds are rejected; higher rounds are
//!    admitted for accounting and quorum checks, but do not mutate local round state)
//! 5. **Vote type**: Only PreVote, PreCommit, and Commit are valid in BFT; Against is
//!    rejected unconditionally. All three accepted types are stored regardless of the
//!    local step — quorum safety is enforced by `maybe_finalize()` and `vote_pool`
//!    composite-key deduplication, not by step-gating at admission.
//!
//! This is enforced by `validate_remote_vote()` and `on_commit_vote()`.
//!
//! ## Proposal Admission (validate_incoming_proposal)
//!
//! Incoming proposals are validated before storage or prevote transition:
//!
//! 1. **Expected proposer**: Must match `compute_proposer_for_round(height, round)`
//! 2. **Proposal signature**: Valid Dilithium signature from the proposer's registered consensus key
//! 3. **Previous-hash continuity**: Links to local chain tip (when verifiable)
//! 4. **Block payload decode**: `block_data` bytes are decodable by the blockchain provider
//!
//! This is enforced by `validate_incoming_proposal()` in `on_proposal()`.
//!
//! ## Quorum is Proposal-Scoped, Not Round-Scoped
//!
//! Quorum calculations are proposal-scoped to prevent split votes from being mistaken for quorum:
//!
//! - **Supermajority requires identical votes**: All votes counted toward quorum must have:
//!   - Same height
//!   - Same round
//!   - Same proposal/block hash
//!   - Same vote type (PreVote or PreCommit)
//! - **Threshold calculation**: 6667 basis points (66.67%) via `has_supermajority()`
//!
//! - **Mixed or split votes DO NOT count**: If validators disagree on which proposal to vote for,
//!   no supermajority is reached until 2/3+1 agree on the same proposal.
//!
//! This is enforced by `count_prevotes_for()`, `count_precommits_for()`, and
//! `check_supermajority()` which use proposal-scoped vote counting.
//!
//! Example: With 4 validators:
//! - Threshold = floor(8/3) + 1 = 3
//! - 2 votes for proposal A + 2 votes for proposal B = 0 quorum (mixed votes)
//! - 3 votes for proposal A = quorum reached
//!
//! ## Step-Independent Vote Storage
//!
//! Votes for the correct height and round are stored regardless of the local consensus
//! step. In an asynchronous network, nodes advance through Propose/PreVote/PreCommit/Commit
//! at different wall-clock times. Step-gating at admission would cause a node in the
//! Commit step to reject valid PreVotes from a peer still in PreVote, making quorum
//! impossible.
//!
//! Safety is preserved because:
//! - Quorum thresholds (2f+1) are enforced in `maybe_finalize()`, not at admission.
//! - Each validator gets exactly one vote per (H, R, type) via `vote_pool` composite-key
//!   deduplication.
//! - Commit votes can finalize immediately regardless of local step (CE-L1, CE-L2).
//!
//! ## No Vote Equivocation
//!
//! A validator cannot vote twice for the same (height, round, vote_type).
//! Multiple votes from the same validator for the same (H,R,type) trigger equivocation detection.
//! This is enforced by the composite key in `VotePoolKey`.
//!
//! ## Design Principles
//!
//! - **Determinism**: Given the same inputs, consensus produces the same sequence of steps.
//! - **Locality**: Vote validation depends only on local state, not network availability.
//! - **Simplicity**: All validation is explicit and fully specified in code comments.
//!
//! ## Validator Rotation Rules and Maximum Churn
//!
//! Validator set changes are **epoch-gated**: all additions and removals take effect only at
//! epoch boundaries (every [`ConsensusConfig::epoch_length_blocks`] blocks).  This prevents
//! mid-epoch validator set instability and ensures every block within an epoch is signed by
//! the same set of validators.
//!
//! ### Maximum churn per epoch
//!
//! To preserve liveness and BFT safety across epoch transitions the number of validators
//! that may change in a single epoch is capped at **one-third of the current active set**:
//!
//! ```text
//! max_churn = floor(active_validators / 3)   (minimum: 1 to allow bootstrapping)
//! ```
//!
//! This is expressed as the constant [`MAX_CHURN_NUMERATOR`] / [`MAX_CHURN_DENOMINATOR`]
//! (= 1/3).  The invariant is enforced by [`ConsensusEngine::apply_epoch_boundary_changes`]
//! before any pending changes are applied.
//!
//! #### Rationale
//!
//! BFT consensus (PBFT/Tendermint) tolerates at most f = floor((n-1)/3) Byzantine validators.
//! If we allowed more than 1/3 of the validator set to be replaced in a single epoch, an
//! adversary could flood the pending queue with registrations and rotate out enough honest
//! validators to break the 2/3 supermajority requirement.  Capping churn at 1/3 per epoch
//! ensures that, even if all incoming validators are adversarial, the existing honest majority
//! is preserved across the transition.
//!
//! #### Rotation priority
//!
//! When the pending change queue contains more changes than the churn budget allows, removals
//! are processed **before** additions (to preserve network safety over growth), and remaining
//! changes are deferred to the following epoch.
